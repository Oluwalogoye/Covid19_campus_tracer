* If a student tests positive, their immediate contacts in the last 48 hours should be tracked and messaged
  * you get to decide how to define immediate contacts 
* The student should be isolated and contacts should be tested
  * If contact test is negative, they should be quaranted
  * If they test potive, they too should be isolated and a contact trace should be run for them too 
* Quarantine and isolation should last for 14 days
